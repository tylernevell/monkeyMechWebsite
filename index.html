        <h2>Metroidvania</h2>
        <p class="description-paragraph">
          You explore a large interconnected world in which most ways are at first
          unpassable until you find new abilities to overcome those obstacles.
          A cornerstone of Monkey Mech’s design was to create abilities that are
          so versatile, they will keep on surprising you by how many different usages
          they have. If you combine your abilities, the possibilities become even bigger.

        <h2>Exploration</h2>
        <p class="description-paragraph">
          Most of the game is about exploring the sandbox world to track down secrets.
          Often you will think you are about to get out of bounds and beat the level
          designer, but right there is a chest waiting for you with a very rewarding
          upgrade. Monkey Mechz respects your lifetime and doesn't bloat the playtime
          with unlimited no-brainer collectibles.

        <h2>Puzzle Design</h2>
        <p class="description-paragraph">
          The deeper you get into the game the more you will be facing creative
          puzzles you've never seen anywhere before, encouraging you to stop
          and think about what abilities you have and how you can use them in
          yet another way. Puzzle types that I already knew from other games
          were immediately rejected in the design process. And it's important
          to me that once you understand the idea behind a puzzle, you can pretty
          much immediately solve it instead of having to go through a cumbersome,
          frustrating execution.

        <h2>Combat</h2>
        <p class="description-paragraph">
          Use a Whip as a weapon like you’ve never been able to before in mouse and keyboard
          based game.  Monkey Mech will borrow from old-school, fast-paced shooter games like
          Unreal, Doom and Quake, encouraging high-speed thinking and reflexes, while throwing
          shot after shot at hordes of charging enemies.
